    <h1>Last Game</h1>
    <p>
        <big>Fan's final vision of Bryant in a <i>purple and gold uniform</i> seven and a half years ago was like many before as the <a href="https://www.nba.com/lakers/" target="_main">Los Angeles Laker</a>'s legend scored a spectacular <b>60 points</b> in his farewell <a href="https://www.nba.com/" target="_main"> <abbr title="National Basketball Association" target="_main">NBA</abbr></a> game. <a href="https://www.nba.com/lakers/" target="_main">The Lakers</a> defeated the <a href="https://www.nba.com/jazz/">Utah Jazz</a> with the score of 101-96. Many notable stars were in attendance, including Snoop Dogg, Kanye West, Beyonce, Jay-Z, Magic Johnson and Shaquille O'Neal. In his final game, Bryant did the most Kobe Bryant thing ever, leaving everything he had on the hardwood of the Staples Center one last time. Outside the <i>arena</i> before the game against the <a href="https://www.nba.com/jazz/">Jazz</a> on that day in <date date-time="2016-04-13">April 13, 2016</date>, fans had chanted, <b><i>“Ko-be! Ko-be!”</i></b></big>
